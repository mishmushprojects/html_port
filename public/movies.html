<h1>The Best Movies According to Masha</h1>
<h2>My Top 4 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>It is a beautiful film, even my Granny loved it.</p>
<h3>Buck</h3>
<p>A movie with the original "Horse Whisperer" Buck Brannaman. A beautiful film really showing the power of 
    understanding.<br />
    Violence is not the solution. This film was 
    likely my first example of nonviolent communication.

<h3>How to Train Your Dragon</h3>
<p>This First film is beautiful. 
I still remember watching it in a small discount movie 
theater in London. I remember walking out and living in a 
world of Fantasy.</p>
<h3>Tibet: The Cry of the Snow Lion</h3>
<p>This is a beautiful introduction to Tibet, 
    buddhism, compassionate understanding. 
    I wanted to know how to see the world as the Monks see the 
    world, and eventually I found this.</p>
